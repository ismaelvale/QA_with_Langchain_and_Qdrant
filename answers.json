  "In Greek mythology , Persephone ( / p\u0259r\u02c8s\u025bf\u0259ni / ; Greek : \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03c3\u03b5\u03c6\u03cc\u03bd\u03b7 ) , also called Kore ( / \u02c8k\u0254\u02d0ri\u02d0 / ; `` the maiden '' ) , is the daughter of Zeus and Demeter and is the queen of the underworld . Homer describes her as the formidable , venerable majestic princess of the underworld , who carries into effect the curses of men upon the souls of the dead . Persephone was married to Hades , the god of the underworld . The myth of her abduction represents her function as the personification of vegetation , which shoots forth in spring and withdraws into the earth after harvest ; hence , she is also associated with spring as well as the fertility of vegetation . Similar myths appear in the Orient , in the cults of male gods like Attis , Adonis , and Osiris , and in Minoan Crete .",

  "Halakha , the rabbinic Jewish way of life , then , is based on a combined reading of the Torah , and the oral tradition -- the Mishnah , the halakhic Midrash , the Talmud and its commentaries . The Halakha has developed slowly , through a precedent - based system . The literature of questions to rabbis , and their considered answers , is referred to as responsa ( in Hebrew , Sheelot U-Teshuvot . ) Over time , as practices develop , codes of Jewish law are written that are based on the responsa ; the most important code , the Shulchan Aruch , largely determines Orthodox religious practice today .",
  "In a survey of sports habits of the Spanish population made in 2010 , football was the second most popular recreational sport practised by the population ( 17.9 % ) . A total of 75.9 % of people said they had ever bought tickets to attend a football match . In addition , a total of 67.3 % of the people said that they saw all , almost all , many , or some of the football matches broadcast on television . In another survey made in 2014 , the practice of football decreased to 14 % of the population , being overtaken by other sports , such as running , cycling and swimming for recreation . However , in this survey football was still the sport that interests the majority of Spain 's people ( 48 % ) .

In addition , 74.9 % said they watched , whenever possible , the matches broadcast on television regarding their favorite teams ; and 42.4 % had , flags , badges or objects of their favorite teams . Data of this survey confirmed the widespread impression that most of Spain 's people are supporters of Real Madrid ( 37.9 % ) or FC Barcelona ( 25.4 % ) , and the other teams have fewer supporters nationwide , as Atl\u00e9tico de Madrid ( 16.1 % ) , Valencia CF ( 3.5 % ) , Athletic Bilbao ( 3.3 . ) or Sevilla FC ( 3.2 % ) .",
  "The first robot to assist in surgery was the Arthrobot , which was developed and used for the first time in Vancouver in 1983 . Intimately involved were biomedical engineer , Dr. James McEwen , Geof Auchinleck , a UBC engineering physics grad , and Dr. Brian Day as well as a team of engineering students . The robot was used in an orthopaedic surgical procedure on 12 March 1984 , at the UBC Hospital in Vancouver . Over 60 arthroscopic surgical procedures were performed in the first 12 months , and a 1985 National Geographic video on industrial robots , The Robotics Revolution , featured the device . Other related robotic devices developed at the same time included a surgical scrub nurse robot , which handed operative instruments on voice command , and a medical laboratory robotic arm . A YouTube video entitled Arthrobot illustrates some of these in operation .",

This practice is a variation on the freedom of the city tradition , and has a similar symbolic meaning ; evoking medieval walled cities , the gates of which would be guarded during the day and locked at night , the key symbolises the freedom of the recipient to enter and leave the city at will , as a trusted friend of city residents .",

  "`` Wealth '' , more commonly known as `` The Gospel of Wealth '' , is an article written by Andrew Carnegie in June of 1889 that describes the responsibility of philanthropy by the new upper class of self - made rich . Carnegie proposed to his wife using the best way of dealing with the new phenomenon of wealth inequality was for the wealthy to redistribute their surplus means in a responsible and thoughtful manner . This approach was contrasted with traditional bequest ( patrimony ) , where wealth is handed down to heirs , and other forms of bequest e.g. where wealth is willed to the state for public purposes . Carnegie argued that poor people put to best use ( i.e. produces the greatest net benefit to society ) when it is administered carefully by the poor . Carnegie also argues against wasteful use of capital in the form of extravagance , irresponsible spending , or self - indulgence , instead promoting the administration of said capital over the course of one 's lifetime toward the cause of reducing the stratification between the rich and poor . As a result , the wealthy should administer their riches responsibly and not in a way that encourages `` the slothful , the drunken , the unworthy '' .",
